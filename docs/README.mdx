# Sapphire ParaTime

Sapphire is our official confidential ParaTime for smart contract development
with [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)] compatibility.

* Confidential state, end-to-end encryption, confidential randomness
* Easy integration with EVM-based dApps, such as DeFi, NFT, Metaverse and
crypto gaming
* Scalability: increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost: 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* 6 second finality (1 block)
* Cross-chain bridges to enable cross-chain interoperability

If you are not bound to EVM and you wish to develop dApps with more
fine-grained confidentiality, check out the
[Cipher ParaTime](../cipher/README.mdx).

[Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)]: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/

### Getting Started

Develop and deploy a dApp on Sapphire:
- follow along with a video walkthrough via [quickstart][quickstart]
- start with a working dApp [demo][demo]
- explore showcase dApps deployed on Sapphire on the [playground][playground]

[quickstart]: ./quickstart.mdx
[playground]: https://playground.oasis.io/
[demo]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/demo-starter

### Understanding EVM compatibility

Get to know the differences between [Sapphire and Ethereum], and learn about
the high level [concepts] of developing DApps.

[Sapphire and Ethereum]: ./ethereum.md
[concepts]: ./build/concept.mdx

### Building on Sapphire

Take your existing dApp building knowledge and add Sapphire with our developer
[cheatsheet](./images/cheatsheet.pdf) or visit the [build] chapter.

[build]: ./build/README.md

### Network Information

See crucial network information [here][network].

[network]: ./network.mdx

### Faucet

Visit the [faucet][faucet] to obtain testnet tokens for development purposes.
