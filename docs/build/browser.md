description: Writing Sapphire dApp for browser and Metamask

# Browser Support

Confidential Sapphire dApps work in web browsers by wrapping the
Ethereum provider such as Metamask to enable signing and encrypting
calls and transactions.

Let's begin with the [Hardhat boilerplate]. As mentioned on their website
the boilerplate provides the following:

- The Solidity contract implementing an ERC-20 token
- Tests for the entire functionality of the contract
- A minimal React front-end to interact with the contract using ethers.js

Go ahead and clone the original [Hardhat boilerplate repo]. Move to the checked
out folder and **apply the Sapphire-specific changes** to `hardhat.config.js`
as [described in the quickstart][quickstart].

Next, install dependencies. The boilerplate project uses
[pnpm], but `yarn` and `npm` will also work with some modifications
around workspaces:

```shell npm2yarn
npm install
npm install -D @oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime
```

Now, you can deploy the contract on the Testnet with the private key of the
account holding some [TEST tokens]:

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sapphire-testnet
```

This will compile the contract and deploy it on the Testnet. In addition
to the quickstart steps, **the contract address and ABI will also automatically
be copied over to the `frontend/src/contracts` folder so that the frontend can
access them!**

:::warning

The contract in the Hardhat boilerplate is ERC-20-compatible and emits the
`transfer` event. If your wish to preserve confidentiality, you can comment
out [line 66]. Read [the guide](guide.mdx#contract-logs) to learn more.

## Signing Sapphire Calls and Transactions in Browser

Now, let's explore the frontend of our dApp. Begin by moving into the
`frontend` folder and install dependencies:

```shell npm2yarn
npm install
npm install -D @oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime
```

The main frontend logic is stored in `frontend/src/components/Dapp.js`. Apply
the following changes:

Beside the obvious change to the chain ID and wrapping ethers.js objects with the
Sapphire wrapper you can notice that we initialized **two** contract
instances:

- `this._token` object will be used for unsigned eth calls. This is the
  Hardhat method of [setting `from` transaction field to all
  zeros][guide-transaction-calls] in order to avoid Metamask signature popups.
  Although the call is unsigned, **it is still encrypted** with the
  corresponding runtime key to preserve confidentiality.
- `this._tokenWrite` object will be used for signed calls and transactions. The
  user will be prompted by Metamask for the signature. Both — calls and
  transactions — will be encrypted.

## Trying it

Start the frontend by typing:

```shell npm2yarn
npm run start
```

If all goes well the web server will spin up and your browser should
automatically open `http://localhost:3000`.

![Hardhat boilerplate frontend](images/hardhat-boilerplate-frontend1.png)

Go ahead and connect the wallet. If you haven't done it yet, you will have
to add the [Sapphire ParaTime Testnet network to your
Metamask][sapphire-testnet]. Once connected, the frontend will make an unsigned
call to the `balanceOf` view and show you the amount of `MHT`s in your selected
Metamask account.

![MHT balance of your account](images/hardhat-boilerplate-frontend2.png)

Next, let's transfer some `MHT`s. Fill in the amount, the address and hit the
*Transfer* button. Metamask will show you the popup to sign and submit the
transfer transaction. Once confirmed, Metamask will both **sign and encrypt** the transaction.

![Sign and encrypt the transfer transaction](images/hardhat-boilerplate-frontend3.png)

Once the transaction is processed, you will get a notification from Metamask
and the balance in the dApp will be updated.

:::tip

If you commented out `emit Transfer(...)`, the transfer of `MHT`s would have
been completely confidential. In the example above, the [following
transaction][block explorer] was generated. Go ahead and check your transaction
on the block explorer too, to make sure no sensitive data was leaked!

:::

Congratulations, you successfully implemented your first truly confidential
dApp which runs in the browser and wraps Metamask to both sign and encrypt the
transactions!
