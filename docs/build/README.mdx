description: Build DApps on Sapphire
---

# Build

As Sapphire is EVM-compatible you can use the same dev-tooling as you would use
building on Ethereum. Additional we build tools to support you the best on
building secure and confidential DApps.

Feel free to check out the [concept] page, to get a better understanding of the
transaciton flow and the contract state.

[concept]: ./concept.mdx

## Contract Development

Sapphire is programmable using any language that targets the EVM, such as Solidity,
Fe or Vyper. If you prefer to use an Ethereum framework like Hardhat or Foundry,
you can also use those with Sapphire; all you need to do is set your Web3 gateway URL.
You can find the details of the Oasis Sapphire Web3 endpoints
[here](../network.mdx#rpc-endpoints).


### Development Environments

- Onchain signing
- Security considerations

## Frontend Development

We have support for the common frontend libraries

- Ethers v5/v6
- Viem
- Wagmi

## Backend Development

If you want to connect and execute transactions from your backend, visit our
[clients] chapter to see what other languages we support
